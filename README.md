# trs80-interface

Encoding and decoding of casette data from TRS-80 model 100 systems.

I also wrote some information on both the encoding system used to store data in audio and the file formats actually stored [here](formats/data_formats.md).
I didn't find much information about this online, what a surprise I guess.
