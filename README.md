# Model 100 Interface [![Build](https://github.com/Basicprogrammer10/model-100-interface/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Basicprogrammer10/model-100-interface/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

Encoding and decoding of casette data from [TRS-80 Model 100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80_Model_100) systems.

I also wrote some information on both the encoding system used to store data in audio and the file formats actually stored [here](formats/data_formats.md).
I didn't find much information about this online, what a surprise I guess.
